| No. | Question | Answer |
| :-- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Diff between HTTP and API? | 1. Definition:<br>• HTTP is just a protocol (a set of rules) for sending data securely over the internet. It works at the network level.<br>• API is an interface that allows two applications to talk to each other. It works at the app level.<br><br>2. Relationship:<br>• APIs usually use HTTP as a vehicle to transport data. So, HTTP is the road, and API is the truck carrying the goods. |
| 2 | HTTP vs Session/Token? | 1. The Problem:<br>• HTTP is stateless. It has no memory. If I login, and then go to the "Settings" page, HTTP forgets who I am.<br><br>2. The Solution:<br>• That is why we need Session Cookies or Tokens.<br>• We send them with every request to tell the server: *"Hey, it's me again, I am already logged in."* This keeps the user connected. |
| 3 | What is a Token? How to test it? | 1. Definition:<br>• A Token (like JWT) is a digital key given by the server after login. The client saves it and sends it back in the Header for future requests.<br><br>2. How I test (Using Chrome):<br>• Get Token: I press F12, go to Application tab, look in Local Storage, and copy the value.<br>• Test Scenario: I take User B's token and paste it into User A's browser. Then I refresh.<br>• Expectation: The system should log me out or block access. If I can see User B's data, it is a Security Bug. |
| 4 | What is a Session? | • A Session is a conversation between the client and server.<br>• It starts when I open the browser and ends when I close it.<br>• Mechanism: The Server saves the user data (Session ID). The Browser only keeps a "Key" (Cookie) to match that ID. When I logout, the server deletes the data. |
| 5 | What is a Cookie? | • A Cookie is a small text file saved on my computer (the client side).<br>• Websites use it to remember things about me, like: "Is he logged in?" or "What is in his shopping cart?" so I don't have to start over every time. |
| 6 | Functional vs Non-functional Test? | 1. Functional Testing:<br>• It answers: *"Does this feature work?"*<br>• Example: Can I login? Does 1 + 1 equal 2?<br><br>2. Non-functional Testing:<br>• It answers: *"How WELL does it work?"*<br>• Example: Is it fast? Is it secure? Can it handle 10,000 users at once (Load test)? |
| 7 | Difference: FE Bug vs API Bug? | I determine this by using the Network Tab (F12):<br><br>• It is an API (Backend) Bug if: The request is sent, but the Server returns an error code (500, 400, 404) or the data returned is wrong.<br><br>• It is a Frontend Bug if: The API returns "200 OK" and correct data, but the screen looks broken, the layout is messy, or buttons don't react when clicked. |
| 8 | Load 100 data in 10s: Func or Non-func? | It is actually BOTH:<br>• Functional part: The system MUST load exactly 100 items (not 99, not 101).<br>• Non-functional part: The system MUST finish this task within 10 seconds.<br><br>• My testing: I count the data AND I use a stopwatch to check the performance. |
| 9 | How to test XSS? | • Concept: XSS is injecting malicious scripts into the website.<br>• How I test: I try to input a script like `<script>alert('Hacked')</script>` into a comment box or search bar.<br>• Result: If a popup appears, it means the developer did not filter the input. That is a bug. The system should just display it as normal text. |
| 10 | What is All-pair method? | • It is a testing strategy.<br>• Why: If we have too many input combinations, we cannot test them all—it takes too long.<br>• How: We use All-pair (or Pairwise) to test pairs of inputs. This reduces the number of test cases but still finds most of the bugs. |
| 11 | Test Permission (IDOR)? | • Scenario: I want to check if User A can delete User B's data.<br>• Steps:<br>  1. I click "Delete" on my own item.<br>  2. I use a tool (like Burp Suite) or F12 to catch the request.<br>  3. I change the ID from `My_ID` to `Target_ID`.<br>  4. I send the request.<br>• Bug: If the item gets deleted, the system has a permission flaw (IDOR). |
| 12 | Dev OK, but QC Fail. Why? | • The most common reason is Browser Cache.<br>• The developer just updated the code, but my browser is still using the old version (old JS/CSS files).<br>• Solution: I always clear the cache (Ctrl+Shift+R) and Local Storage before testing again. |
| 13 | Layout vs UI Testing? | • Layout Testing: Focuses on structure. Is the margin correct? Is the alignment straight? Does it break on mobile?<br>• UI Testing: Focuses on the whole interface. It includes Layout plus Colors, Fonts, Images, and the overall "Look and Feel" of the app. |
| 14 | Web App vs Native App? | • Web App: Runs on a browser (Chrome/Safari). No download needed. Needs internet.<br>• Native App: Installed directly on the phone (from App Store). It can use hardware like Camera, GPS, and Fingerprint better. It can often work offline. |
| 15 | Branch vs Statement coverage? | • Statement Coverage: We make sure every single line of code runs at least once.<br>• Branch Coverage: We make sure every "Decision" is tested. For every `IF` condition, we must test both the TRUE case and the FALSE case. |
| 16 | Exception vs Validation testing? | • Validation: Testing the "Happy Path". Does the system work when I enter valid data?<br>• Exception: Testing the "Sad Path". Does the system handle errors gracefully (without crashing) when I enter bad data or when the network fails? |
| 17 | Regression vs Performance Tool? | • Regression Tool (e.g., Selenium): It records my actions and replays them to make sure new code didn't break old features.<br>• Performance Tool (e.g., JMeter): It simulates thousands of virtual users hitting the server at the same time to check speed and stability. |
| 18 | Glass-box testing? | • It is just another name for White-box testing.<br>• It means the tester can "see inside the box"—I understand the code structure and logic, so I design test cases based on the code, not just the requirements. |
| 19 | What is ODBC? | • Open Database Connectivity.<br>• Ideally, apps speak different languages than databases. ODBC is like a translator (Bridge). It allows my application to connect and send SQL commands to *any* database (SQL Server, Oracle, etc.) easily. |
| 20 | Key injection characters? | • These are special characters used to test for SQL Injection.<br>• I usually try: `'` (single quote), `--` (comment), `##`, or `1=1`.<br>• If the database returns an error or shows hidden data, it is vulnerable. |
| 21 | Mobile Web vs Desktop Web? | • The main difference is the Layout and User Experience.<br>• Mobile: Vertical view, small screen, uses Touch.<br>• Desktop: Horizontal view, large screen, uses Mouse.<br>• Testing: I must check if the menu collapses correctly and if elements overlap when resizing the screen. |
| 22 | What are some common Bug Tracking Systems and their characteristics? | 1. TestTrack Pro (Leapfrog):<br>- *Bad point:* It logs you out (loses session) after 20 minutes.<br>- *Good point:* The filter feature is extremely good and effective.<br><br>2. Frog Bug (Evernote):<br>- *Bad point:* Searching for bugs is very poor. For example, if you search for a keyword that is definitely in the summary, it might not show up. Or, if there are no results, the page just goes blank (it doesn't say "No results"), which makes you think the system crashed.<br><br>3. Unfuddle (Synaptics):<br>- *Feature:* When you search by keyword, it looks inside both the summary AND the comments. This makes the results too messy and diluted (e.g., you only have 5 real bugs, but it shows pages of results because the keyword is in the comments).<br><br>4. Jira:<br>- *Feature:* This is very popular. The search ability is okay, not bad, but honestly not as good as TestTrack Pro.<br><br>5. Track Gear (LTRC):<br>- Another system that is also used. |
| 23 | What systems are used for Test Case Management? | 1. Rarely (Paid):<br>- *Feature:* Very cool. It allows you to run a Test Case (TC) on multiple browsers at once and reports the result (Pass/Fail) for all 3 browsers simultaneously, with a comparison chart.<br><br>2. Test Topia & Aptech Manager (Free):<br>- *Bad point:* You can only see the status on one browser at a time. If you want to know the result on another browser, you have to go back to that TC and run it again on the other browser.<br><br>3. TFS (Team Foundation Server):<br>- Currently used at KMS (Alere project) to log bugs. |
| 24 | What system is used to keep track of test progress? | Test Director: We use this to monitor and manage test cases. |
| 25 | What is a Test Case? Its structure and what makes a "Best" Test Case? | Definition: A test case is a set of conditions, input variables, and expected results to check if a function of the app is working correctly or not.<br><br>Basic Structure:<br>- Test Case ID<br>- Test Description<br>- Pre-condition<br>- Test Steps<br>- Test Data<br>- Expected Result<br><br>Best Test Case: It is a set of test cases that covers ALL functions and possible scenarios. A system is considered "good" when, after running this set of test cases, no more bugs appear. |
| 26 | What is a Bug Report? What is its structure? | Definition: It is a detailed document describing an error so the Developer can understand and fix it.<br><br>Structure:<br>1. Prefix [Environment]: Where the bug happened.<br>2. Bug Title: A summary of the bug.<br>3. Priority: How urgent it is.<br>4. Test Steps: Steps to reproduce the bug.<br>5. Actual Result: The wrong result happening now.<br>6. Expected Result: The correct result we want.<br>7. Screenshot/Video: Evidence of the bug. |
| 27 | Why do we make a Test Plan? What are its components? | Purpose: To define the scope, approach, resources, and schedule for testing activities.<br><br>Main Components:<br>1. Scope (In-scope/Out-scope).<br>2. Test Strategy.<br>3. Resources & Roles.<br>4. Schedule.<br>5. Test Environment.<br>6. Risks & Assumptions.<br>7. Entry/Exit Criteria. |
| 28 | What is Black Box Testing? | Definition: It’s a method where we test WITHOUT knowing the code structure or internal logic. The Tester only cares about Input and Output.<br><br>Example: When testing an app, I only need to know what data to enter and what result to expect. I don't need to know how the program processes it. This allows Testers and Developers to work independently. |
| 29 | What is White Box Testing? | It is a method to test the internal structure, code logic, and data flow. Usually, this is done during the Unit Test phase by the Developer themselves. |
| 30 | What is the difference between SQA and PQA? | PQA (Process Quality Assurance):<br>- *Task:* Ensure quality of the *process*.<br>- *Work:* Build standard processes (ISO, CMMI) and monitor if teams are following them to improve the workflow.<br><br>SQA (Software Quality Assurance):<br>- *Task:* Ensure quality of the *software (product)*.<br>- *Work:* Test after QC has tested (or test intermediate stages) to ensure consistency before delivery to the client. SQA is responsible to the customer and must know the critical points (quickpoints) to test. |
| 31 | QA vs. QC: Differences? Which one is harder? | QC (Quality Control - Tester):<br>- *Task:* Run the program, review code to find bugs. Check if the product matches the design and business rules.<br>- *Nature:* Technical focus, working directly with the software.<br><br>QA (Quality Assurance):<br>- *Task:* Monitor the process, ensure the team follows templates and standards.<br>- *Nature:* Focus on "paperwork" and process, requires management experience.<br><br>Who works harder?<br>- Equal, depends on the project. QA is like "taking care of a baby"—lots of unnamed tasks, often OT. Tester has pressure on deadlines (if Dev is slow, Tester must rush) and pressure of missing bugs (like a goalkeeper: catch it and it's a draw, miss it and you get blamed). |
| 32 | When do we stop testing? | When the software is no longer used by the End-user. (Or when we meet criteria like: out of budget, out of time, or covered all requirements - but logically, testing only truly ends when the product dies). |
| 33 | What is the Testing Process? | Testing is a phase in the SDLC, usually on the right side of the V-Model.<br><br>Main Steps:<br>1. Requirement Analysis.<br>2. Test Planning (Plan type, resources, time, risk).<br>3. Test Case Development.<br>4. Test Execution.<br>5. Bug Reporting.<br>6. Test Closure. |
| 34 | What is the Bug Lifecycle? | 1. New: Bug is logged.<br>2. Open: Leader approves and assigns to Dev.<br>3. In Progress/Fixing: Dev is fixing it.<br>4. Fixed: Dev finished fixing.<br>5. Pending Retest: Waiting for Tester to check.<br>6. Retest:<br>   - If fixed -> Closed/Verified.<br>   - If not fixed -> Reopen (send back to Dev). |
| 35 | When does Testing start? | It starts right from the Requirement and Design phase - this is called Early Testing. |
| 36 | Common Software Development Models? | - V-model (Testing runs parallel to development).<br>- Scrum/Agile (Flexible, split into sprints).<br>- Waterfall (Sequential, a bit old-school but still used). |
| 37 | Acceptance Test vs. Regression Test? | Acceptance Test: Test to confirm if the system meets the client's/user's criteria (final step before release).<br><br>Regression Test: Test the software again after new code is added or bugs are fixed, to make sure the new changes didn't break old functions. |
| 38 | What are Value and Value Type? | Value: The specific input/output (e.g., "5", "Hello").<br>Value type: The data type (String, int, float, boolean...). |
| 39 | Difference between Verification & Validation? | Verification: *Do the things right?*<br>- Check if software follows the Spec document EXACTLY.<br>- *Example:* Spec says input text -> Test input text. If it works, it passes Verification.<br><br>Validation: *Do the right things?*<br>- Check if the function SUITS the End-user's needs.<br>- *Example:* Input text works, but the font is too small to read, or it accepts malicious code -> Fails Validation (bad user experience/safety). |
| 40 | Test Function vs. Test Scenario? | Test Function:<br>- Used in Functional Test.<br>- Test cases for specific functions independently.<br>- Need rule tables for complex logic.<br><br>Test Scenario:<br>- Used in Performance Test or UAT.<br>- It is a script with many steps (Test Cases) following the real User's flow.<br>- *Note:* Need to draw a flow chart to avoid missing states. |
| 41 | Test Methods? | - White box: Test code/structure.<br>- Black box: Test input/output.<br>- Grey box: Combination (Tester understands the database/logic but tests as an End-user). |
| 42 | What is Functional Testing? | Checking if the system features work according to the design (e.g., Login, Search, Add to cart...). |
| 43 | What is Integration Testing? | Checking the interaction and data transfer between different modules/components after they are combined. |
| 44 | What is System Testing? | Testing the WHOLE complete system to ensure it meets both functional and non-functional requirements. |
| 45 | What is Alpha Testing? | - Testing at the production site (internal).<br>- Audience: Internal team or limited potential customers.<br>- Requirement: Must sign NDA (confidentiality) because the product is not public yet. |
| 46 | What is Beta Testing? | - Happens after Alpha.<br>- Release a Beta version to a group of real users to try.<br>- Purpose: Collect bugs from real users so the provider can fix them before the official launch. |
| 47 | What is Unit Test? | Testing the smallest unit of software (function, class, method). Nowadays, Devs usually do this. |
| 48 | What is Shakeout Testing (Configuration Test)? | - Testing configuration, network, Database, environment.<br>- Done by the config management team to set up the test environment.<br>- Checks if main functions are "alive" before starting System Test (Must pass 100%). |
| 49 | Do we test the database? | Yes.<br>- Need to know Basic Database knowledge.<br>- Need to apply SQL Injection tests (security holes) using standard patterns. |
| 50 | Which is more important: (A) Meeting User Needs or (B) Finding Bugs? | Answer A. Checking if the system meets user needs is more important. (Because a bug-free software that users cannot use is meaningless). |
| 51 | Is a PASSED result always good? | Not necessarily.<br>- Example: System says "Insert successful" (Passed UI), but actually, no data is in the Database -> Need to check deeper (check DB). |
| 52 | What to do if the Project documentation is unclear? | Process:<br>1. Investigate the workflow.<br>2. Look for old layouts or ask the BA.<br>3. Ask the Dev how they understand the rule.<br>4. Confirm unclear points with Client/BA.<br>5. Write Test cases (update while testing).<br>6. Update Test cases again after understanding the function. |
| 53 | When Actual Result differs from Expected Result, what do you do? | Check if the Actual Result is good for the End-user:<br>- If it benefits the User: Suggest BA to update the Spec.<br>- If not: Log a bug. |
| 54 | Definition of a Good Tester? | Careful, always focuses on End-user needs, sticks to requirements, and finally, has humorous communication skills (to reduce stress with Devs). |
| 55 | What if Dev cannot reproduce your bug? | Check my environment again:<br>1. Clear Cache.<br>2. Use Incognito mode.<br>3. Clear Local Storage.<br>4. Check if it's the right Build version.<br>-> If it still happens, I will demo it directly to the Dev. |
| 56 | It is clearly a bug but Dev says "Won't fix"? | - Prove it is in the Spec -> Dev MUST fix.<br>- If the Spec is illogical -> Escalate to BA to resolve. |
| 57 | Test Stages and Objects? | 1. Unit Test: Code, functions (Dev does this).<br>2. Integration Test: Integrated modules.<br>3. System Test: The whole system.<br>4. Acceptance Test: Business, customer needs. |
| 58 | Difference between Regression Testing and Re-testing? | Re-testing: Test ONLY the function/bug that was just fixed to see if it's gone.<br>Regression Testing: Test that function AND related functions to make sure the fix didn't create NEW bugs. |
| 59 | Too many Test cases but not enough time, what to do? | 1. Update Scope -> Negotiate deadline with client.<br>2. Do Smoke Test (critical features).<br>3. Prioritize Verification (run per Spec first).<br>4. Do Ad-hoc testing.<br>5. Set Priority:<br>   - High: Test carefully.<br>   - Low: Skip if no time.<br>6. If the build fails main functions -> Reject immediately to save time. |
| 60 | Are Test Tools valuable? Why? | Yes.<br>1. Solve resource issues (e.g., run a case 100 times, tool is faster).<br>2. Reduce Regression Test time.<br>3. Test special environments (e.g., Load test 1000 users at once -> Manual cannot do this). |
| 61 | List 3 Test Tools and their use? | 1. QTP (Paid): Supports Win, Web. Script in VB, multi-browser, supports teamwork.<br>2. OpenSTA (Free/Paid plugin): Focus on Web Performance, runs on Win.<br>3. Selenium (Free):<br>   - Test on multiple browsers.<br>   - IDE: Record actions.<br>   - RC/Grid: Run scripts on many browsers/machines. |
| 62 | Name 2 reference standards for testing? | TMM (Test Maturity Model) and CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration). |
| 63 | Why is Testing necessary? | It increases profit by reducing the cost of fixing bugs. The 1-10-100 rule: 1 dollar to prevent a bug (Design/Test early) saves 10 dollars correcting it, and saves 100 dollars if the failure happens in the market. |
| 64 | What is Early Testing? | - Testing during Design/Requirement phase (no code yet).<br>- Dev and Test clarify Spec/Workflow together.<br>- Goal: Unified understanding, helping Dev code right from the start.<br>- Reduces bugs caused by misunderstanding Specs, avoids rejecting builds many times. |
| 65 | What is Static Testing? 3 techniques? | Definition: Testing documents/code WITHOUT running the program (using brain, pen, paper). Check logic of Spec.<br>3 techniques:<br>1. Informal Reviews.<br>2. Technical Reviews.<br>3. Static Analysis (using tools - Data Flow/Control Flow). |
| 66 | Bug Priority Levels? | 1. Critical: System crash, data loss -> Fix immediately.<br>2. High: Major function fails -> Fix in next build.<br>3. Medium: Minor function fails, has work-around -> Fix later.<br>4. Low: UI, typo -> Fix when free. |
| 67 | How to test "User Friendly" and "Easy to Install"? | a. Friendly: Check if there are feedback messages for every action.<br>b. Easy to Install: Check if there is a guideline document included. |
| 68 | Integration Test Methods? | 1. Big-bang: Combine all modules at once -> Hard to find cause of bugs.<br>2. Incremental: Combine step-by-step.<br>3. Top-down: General to detailed.<br>4. Bottom-up: Detailed to general.<br>5. Thread: Test by logical flow of features. |
| 69 | The 80-20 Rule in Testing? | - System Test: 80% time Dev codes, 20% test functions.<br>- Acceptance Test: 80% time Client tests functions, 20% Dev fixes bugs (if any). |
| 70 | Why put the Contract in the Acceptance Test Plan? | Initially, clients want many features but have low budget. BA adjusts the Spec to fit the budget and writes it in the Contract. We build based on this Contract Spec. During Acceptance Test, we must ensure the client tests based on the Contract Spec (what was agreed), not their initial "dream Spec". |
| 71 | What is "Integration testing in the large"? | It is extended integration testing, connecting with other systems (LAN/WAN, 3rd party, plugins, other internal systems).<br>Approach: Identify Risks. Example: System 1 (A, B, C) connects to System 2 (A, B', C'). The risk is conflict between B-B' or C-C'. |
| 72 | What is Maintenance Testing? | Testing when there is code change or new features on a running system.<br>Rule: Only test the new feature and ensure old features still work. Tester needs to know which area the code affects to scope the test, no need to re-test the whole system. |
| 73 | Client wants 500 cases on IE and 500 on Firefox. How to optimize? | Solution: Use experience to compare IE and FF.<br>- For Logic/Input cases (Verification): Test on 1 browser only (server logic is the same).<br>- For UI/Validate cases (Validation): Test on both.<br>Result: 500 cases on IE take 10 weeks, but FF only takes 7 weeks (skip the passed logic cases). |
| 74 | Notes on "Test follow feel"? | When Spec contradicts user needs or documentation is missing -> Log bug for the Client (don't assign to Dev because Dev followed Spec).<br>- Discuss with client to change Spec.<br>- If client refuses -> Continue testing following Spec.<br>Note: This depends on the Tester's feeling, requires experience (5+ years) to do well. |
| 75 | What is TDD? | Test Driven Development: An Agile method. Write Test cases FIRST, then write code to pass those test cases. |
| 76 | Early Testing (Addition)? | Similar to TDD but applied in Design phase. Dev and Test agree on rules before working -> Significantly reduces bugs caused by misunderstanding. |
| 77 | Difference between Mobile Testing and Web Testing? | 1. Hardware (RAM, Screen).<br>2. Layout.<br>3. Rotate screen.<br>4. Small text difficult to read.<br>5. Hardware Back button differs from Browser Back button.<br>6. Tombstone (App sleep/restore state).<br>7. Crash (App crashes easily).<br>8. Shake feature. |
| 78 | What is IP WAN? How to get it? | 1. Definition:<br>- IP WAN (Public IP) is the address the Internet Service Provider (ISP) gives to your Modem/Router.<br>- Function: It acts like a unique "house address" on the internet, allowing outside systems to connect to your internal network (unlike IP LAN which is just inside the office/home).<br><br>2. Usage in Test:<br>- Test Geo-blocking features (block/allow access by region).<br>- Security test (Firewall whitelist/blacklist).<br><br>3. Tool:<br>- Check IP and location at: [http://ip2location.com/](http://ip2location.com/) |
| 79 | Why separate Dev and Test environments? | To avoid conflict. We need: Separate Data, Server, Client.<br>Process: Dev Push code -> Test Pull code to update -> Run test -> Versioning. |
| 80 | What is Penetration Testing? Describe a specific attack method? | 1. Definition:<br>It is using experts (Pentesters) to simulate attacks on the system. The goal is to find and fix holes before real hackers exploit them.<br><br>2. Specific Method (Example: SQL Injection):<br>- Scenario: At the Login screen.<br>- Action: Instead of a username, I type a special code into the User field, like: `' OR '1'='1`.<br>- Logic: The Database is tricked by math logic: "1 equals 1" is always TRUE.<br>- Result: System is tricked, skips password check, and logs straight into the Admin account, allowing the hacker to steal all data. |
| 81 | Which systems need Penetration Testing? | Anything related to storing and processing info:<br>- OS, Apps, Database, Network devices.<br>- Website, Web-app.<br>- Perimeter Network (Firewall, Router).<br>- Internal Network, Wireless Network.<br>- Social Engineering (Attacking people).<br>- Physical access. |
| 82 | Why do we need Penetration Testing? | - Reduce/Prevent risk of losing revenue (due to hackers, bad staff, system errors).<br>- Protect reputation and customer trust.<br>- Identify security holes to react in time and plan security budget properly. |
| 83 | What are the advantages of Scrum? | 1. About the Goal:<br>- The system focuses on short-term goals.<br><br>2. About the Manager (PM):<br>- It helps the PM manage work much easier.<br>- It makes sure no task is forgotten or missed.<br><br>3. About the Product Owner (PO):<br>- Responsibility: The PO has higher responsibility for the project. (Unlike other models where the PO just gives the specs, waits for release, and complains if it’s wrong).<br>- Awareness: The PO always knows exactly where the project is going.<br><br>4. About Controlling Delivery:<br>- Who checks: The PO and Scrum Master.<br>- How: They control the delivery date by comparing the Points done in a Sprint with the estimated Points.<br><br>5. About Risk Management:<br>- We can control risks when there are changes in the requirements (specs). |
| 84 | What are the disadvantages of Scrum? | 1. Participation:<br>- The PO must join the process directly.<br><br>2. Personnel:<br>- The team members need to be Seniors (experienced people). |
| 85 | What are the roles in Scrum and their detailed tasks? | 1. Product Owner (PO)<br>- Action 1: They set the priority for tasks.<br>- Action 2: They approve the User Story Point estimation for the Team.<br>- Action 3: They approve the Sprintlog estimation for the Team.<br><br>2. Scrum Master<br>- Action 1: They manage the User Story Point estimation.<br>- Action 2: They manage the Sprintlog estimation and the actual time of the Team -> Then they report it to the PO.<br>- Action 3: They negotiate (deal) with the PO about changing the delivery day.<br><br>3. Team Member<br>- Action 1: They do the User Story Point estimation.<br>- Action 2: They do the Sprintlog estimation.<br>- Action 3: They do the actual work. |
| 86 | What are the Models in the process? | Model: Task handling, deploy build, task life cycle, bug life cycle, process testing, strategy testing, process handling task for member, process handling task for leader.<br><br>*(Detail: This is the list of workflows in the project. You need to understand the flow of work: New Task -> Dev Code -> Deploy -> Test -> Log Bug -> Fix Bug -> Close Task. Each role (Member or Leader) has different responsibilities in each model).* |
| 87 | What is the Build Flow (Process when receiving a new build)? | Receive new build -> smoke test -> if pass (verify and regression test-execute-adhoc) -> If fail (reject build) -> report and loop again this process.<br><br>*(Detail: <br>- Smoke test: Quick test of main features (15-30 mins) to make sure the build does not crash or have blocker bugs. If Smoke fails -> Reject build immediately.<br>- Regression test: Re-test old features to make sure new code didn't break them.<br>- Ad-hoc: Random testing based on experience, not following scripts, to find hidden bugs).* |
| 88 | What is the Bug Life Cycle? | New -> assigned -> resolved (fixed-invalid-wonfix-duplicate-move-workforme) -> ready for test -> if pass -> close bug -> if fail -> reopened.<br><br>*(Detail on statuses:<br>- Invalid: The bug is not valid (maybe misunderstanding specs or environment error).<br>- Won't fix: Bug is accepted but we won't fix it (low risk or too expensive).<br>- Duplicate: Same as a bug logged before.<br>- Works for me: Dev cannot reproduce the bug (it works fine on Dev's machine).<br>- Reopened: Dev said "fixed", but Tester checks again and the bug is still there).* |
| 89 | What is Early Testing? | Early testing<br><br>*(Detail: It means starting testing activities as soon as possible in the SDLC. For example: Reviewing requirement documents at the beginning to find logic errors before Dev writes code. Benefit: Saves cost and time for fixing bugs).* |
| 90 | What is Verify? | Verify (make sure the product works properly with spec)<br><br>*(Detail: "Are we building the product right?" - We check if the product follows the design and technical documents perfectly. Focus on process and documentation).* |
| 91 | What is Validation? | Validation (make sure the product is the thing users need, spec is logic and consistent with end user. Don't care spec)<br><br>*(Detail: "Are we building the right product?" - We check if the product meets the real needs of the user, even if the spec doesn't mention it. Focus on user experience and end-user needs).* |
| 92 | What are the Priority levels? | Priority (high-medium-low)<br><br>*(Detail: Order of fixing - Based on Business perspective. <br>- High: Must fix immediately (e.g., payment error, homepage error).<br>- Low: Can fix later (e.g., small typo, slight color difference)).* |
| 93 | What are the Severity levels? | Severity (Blocker-critical-major-normal-minor-enhancement)<br><br>*(Detail: Seriousness of the bug - Based on Technical perspective and system impact.<br>- Blocker: Cannot continue testing.<br>- Critical: Main function is dead.<br>- Minor: Small bug, low impact on function).* |
| 94 | What is the strategy for "Testing in short time"? | Testing in short time (testing from high priority to low priority [verify+main function-validate])<br><br>*(Detail: When deadline is tight, we cannot run 100% test cases. We use Risk-based testing:<br>1. Run cases with highest Priority.<br>2. Test the Main flow (Happy case).<br>3. Only do basic validation, skip edge cases).* |
| 95 | What is the strategy for "Testing on many environments"? | Testing on many environments (run all testcases on a main browser - on another browser testing function regarding to javascript and layout or UI)<br><br>*(Detail: We don't run full test cases on every browser/device because it takes too much time. <br>- Choose 1 main browser (e.g., Chrome) to run Full Test Cases.<br>- Other browsers (Firefox, Safari...): Only check UI and functions using complex JavaScript).* |
| 96 | What is TDD? | TDD (Test Driven Development)<br><br>*(Detail: Development driven by testing. Process: Write Test case first (Fail) -> Write Code to pass that test (Pass) -> Refactor code. Helps code be clean and have fewer bugs).* |
| 97 | What is BDD? | BDD (Behavior Driven Development)<br><br>*(Detail: Development driven by behavior. Use natural language to describe test scenarios (Given - When - Then) so Dev, Tester, and Client can all understand. Example: Given I am on home page, When I click Login, Then I see Dashboard).* |
| 98 | Example of Boundary Value Analysis? | Boundary (x>1 -> x=2 & x=1)<br><br>*(Detail: Bugs often appear at the boundaries of input conditions. <br>Example: Input age > 18.<br>- Boundaries to test: 18 (lower boundary), 19 (valid value near boundary), 17 (invalid value near boundary). <br>- Goal: Find bugs at the transition between right and wrong).* |
| 99 | Example of Equivalence Partitioning? | Equivalence partition (3>x>1 -> x=2)<br><br>*(Detail: Divide input data into equal groups. If one value in a group works, others will work too.<br>Example: Input quantity from 1 to 100.<br>- Valid group: Choose 50.<br>- Invalid group: Choose -1 or 101. <br>- Goal: Reduce number of test cases).* |
| 100 | What is a Decision Table? | Decision table<br><br>*(Detail: Used when logic depends on many conditions combined leading to different actions. <br>Example: Condition "VIP Client" + "Buy > 1 million" -> Action "Discount 10%". This table lists all True/False combinations so we don't miss any case).* |
| 101 | How do you handle Backup and restore database? | - Full backup data test from data client<br>- There are 2 data (data for dev and data for test)<br>- When find bug -> backup transaction log<br>- When reproduce -> restore full backup -> restore transaction log<br><br>*(Detail on Data process for hard bugs:<br>1. Get real data (if allowed) or full sample data for baseline (Full backup).<br>2. Dev and Test environments must be separate.<br>3. When finding a bug: Immediately save the Transaction log (history of DB actions) at that moment.<br>4. To Reproduce: Restore the original Full backup + run the Transaction log to bring the system back to exactly when the bug happened).* |
| 102 | How to perform Database testing? | Database (update on app then query to check in database - otherwise)<br><br>*(Detail: Check data integrity.<br>- Method 1: Do action on UI -> Query Database to see if data is saved correctly.<br>- Method 2: Insert/Update directly in Database -> Check if UI displays correctly).* |
| 103 | What does Security testing include? | Security (injection test, login B delete item by id A)<br><br>*(Detail: <br>- Injection test: Popular is SQL Injection (put malicious SQL code into input).<br>- Login B delete item by id A (IDOR): Permission bug. User B logs in but changes ID in URL to delete or see data of User A).* |
| 104 | What does Functional testing include? | Function (insert: XSS,...often test with UI(back&forward-feedback&message,...))<br><br>*(Detail: Check features against specs.<br>- CRUD actions (Create, Read, Update, Delete).<br>- Test Navigation (Back/Forward button - does it keep data?).<br>- Test Messages (Success/Fail).<br>- Check Input: Include XSS test (Cross-site scripting) - input malicious script to see if system filters it).* |
| 105 | What does Performance testing measure? | Performance (response time)<br><br>*(Detail: Focus on Response time when system has load.<br>- Load Testing: Test with expected number of users.<br>- Stress Testing: Test over the limit to see how the system breaks).* |
| 106 | What does Mobile testing include? | - Localization (format font, time-time zone-language): *(Time format, region language)*<br>- Tombstone/Interrupt: *(Interruption: Incoming call, SMS, low battery, app runs in background then open again - any crash or data loss?)*<br>- Crash: *(App closes suddenly)*<br>- Missing: *(Missing images or data)*<br>- Text cut off: *(Text is cut because screen is small)*<br>- Overlap/Spill out: *(Text/Image overlaps or spills out of frame)*<br>- Wrong navigation: *(Go to wrong screen)*<br>- Wrong position: *(Wrong display position)*<br>- Block until load complete: *(App freezes, cannot touch while loading)*<br>- List empty/ blank page: *(Handle when list is empty)*<br>- App don't update data or appear new record after update one record: *(Refresh data error)*<br>- First login -> crash or don't display full UI: *(Error on first time opening app)*<br>- Go back previous screen (after log out still can go back user screen without login again): *(Security bug: Logout then click Back, still see old page)*<br>- Don't redirect to complete screen (still display detail screen after show message complete -> therefore user can submit form again): *(Duplicate data bug because user can submit many times)* |
| 107 | Difference between mobile testing and web? | - Speed: *(Mobile depends on 3G/4G/Wifi - unstable)*<br>- Screen: *(Mobile has many screen sizes and resolutions)*<br>- Layout: *(Mobile space is small, vertical layout; Web is horizontal)*<br>- Rotate: *(Mobile can rotate Landscape/Portrait)*<br>- Go back on mobile difference with browser: *(Hard Back button on Android vs Back button on browser)*<br>- Tombstone/interrupt: *(Web has less interruption than Mobile - calls, SMS)*<br>- Crash: *(Mobile App crashes easier due to hardware/RAM; Web only crashes browser tab)*<br>- Font size is small, hard to reading: *(Display issue on small screen)* |
| 108 | Main components of Scrum and process of 1 task? | - Backlog: *(List of all project requirements)*<br>- Sprint backlog: *(List of tasks committed for 1 Sprint)*<br>- Sprint planning > estimation > execute > review & report > change status: <br>*(Standard process:<br>1. Planning: Pick tasks and estimate points.<br>2. Execute: Dev codes, Tester tests.<br>3. Daily Scrum: Meeting every day to report progress.<br>4. Review: Demo product at end of Sprint.<br>5. Retrospective: Meeting to learn from mistakes).* |
| 109 | What is Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) in Estimation? | Work Breakdown structure (WBS)<br><br>*(Detail: A technique to break down a big project or complex feature into smaller parts. This makes it easier to manage and estimate time more accurately. Example: "Login" feature broken down into: UI, Validate, API connect, Database check).* |
| 110 | What is Planning Poker in Estimation? | Planning poker<br><br>*(Detail: An estimation technique in Scrum (Agile). Team members use cards (Fibonacci numbers: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8...) to vote on the difficulty (Point) of a task together. Goal: Avoid following the crowd and reach objective agreement).* |
